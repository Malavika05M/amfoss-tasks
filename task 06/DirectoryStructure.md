![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06ac0ce9-706d-4da2-9c69-a5b52f013e43)

# Explanation of Each directory and file 

**1**. **`polls/`**

This folder contains the core logic of the Poll app. It houses the models, views, templates, and other application-specific files.

**.** **migrations/**: This folder contains migration files for tracking changes to the models over time. The files are automatically generated by Django when you run the makemigrations command.

**.** `0001_initial.py`: The initial migration file, which sets up the database schema for the `Question` and `Choice` models.

**.** `__init__.py`: A standard Python file to mark the directory as a Python package.

**.** **templates/polls/**: This directory contains the HTML templates used by the app.

  **.** `index.html`: Displays a list of available polls.

   **.** `detail.html`: Displays the details of a specific poll and allows users to vote.

   **.** `results.html`: Shows the results of the poll after voting.

`__init__.py`: Marks the `polls` directory as a Python package.

`admin.py`: Registers the models (`Question`, `Choice`) with the Django admin interface so they can be managed through the admin panel.

`apps.py`: Defines the configuration for the `polls` app. The `PollsConfig` class in this file is used to configure app-specific settings.

`models.py`: Contains the definitions for the database models, including `Question` and `Choice`, which are central to the app’s functionality.

`tests.py`: Contains unit tests for the application. It includes tests for models, views, and other app logic.

`urls.py`: Maps the URLs of the app to the corresponding views. Defines routes such as `/polls/`, `/polls/<id>/`, and `/polls/<id>/results/`.

`views.py`: Handles the logic for displaying polls, voting, and showing results. It defines views like `index`, `detail`, `results`, and `vote`.

2. **`mysite/`**
   
This folder contains the project-level settings and configuration files. It is the project scaffold generated by Django when the project was created.

**.** `__init__.py`: Marks the mysite directory as a Python package.

**.** `asgi.py`: This file is used to run the project with the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface). It’s mainly used for asynchronous communication protocols.

**.** `settings.py`: The central configuration file for the project. It contains the database settings, installed apps, middleware, static files configuration, and other project-wide settings.

**.** `urls.py`: The project-wide URL configuration file. It maps the root URLs (/admin/ and /polls/) to the corresponding applications.

**.** `wsgi.py`: This file is used to run the project with WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), which is typically used for deploying Django applications in a production environment.

**3.** **`db.sqlite3`**

This is the SQLite database file. By default, Django uses SQLite as its database engine for development purposes. This file stores the database, including the tables for Question, Choice, and other app data.

**4.** **`manage.py`**

This is a command-line utility script that allows you to interact with the Django project. Some common commands include:

`python manage.py runserver`: Starts the Django development server.

`python manage.py migrate`: Applies database migrations.

`python manage.py createsuperuser`: Creates a new superuser for the Django admin interface.

**5.** **`requirements.txt`**

This file contains a list of the project’s dependencies. These packages can be installed using pip:

**6.** **`venv/`**

This directory is for the virtual environment, which isolates project dependencies. It contains the installed packages, Python binaries, and other environment-specific files.

**Note: The** `venv/` **directory may not be present in all versions of the repository as it's usually excluded via** `.gitignore`.
