For the Telegram bot , Initially i created a virtual environment using python `python3 -m venv venv` , then proceeded by activating it with `source venv/bin/activate`.

The next step involved downloading the necessary python packages required which was done with `pip install python-telegram-bot requests python-dotenv`.

A text editor `nano` was used to store the code related to the telegram bot : `nano telebot.py`. In nano , the codes after changes can be saved using `ctrl + o` and after everything is done , we can exit it using `ctrl + x`.

For creating the code , i did seek help using google and chatgpt since i was new to the concept and understand it. There were quite some errors in the beginning while running so i had to figure them out and modify the code.

After the code was done , I went to google cloud console and got the API key for Google books. Steps were followed using google. Similarly used telegram to create a new bot and received a telegram token.
The token and the key was then stored in a `.env` file for further use.

After running python telebot.py, the bot was active and started receiving.
