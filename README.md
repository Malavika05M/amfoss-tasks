# Introduction
Hi , I'm Malavika from S1 CS(AI).I had a bio- background in high school , therefore I'm just aware of the basic computing and programming language stuff. 
My curiosity for the tech world has driven me to pursue a degree in Computer Science.

# Why should we choose you?
Being a tech enthusiast, I've always been passionate about Programming and engaging in computing activities. I always try to be updated about the tech world and various aspects of it. 
My Curiosity helps me to learn and be open to new informations. I can stay up as long as I want to until the task i'm working on is completed. 
By preparing for entrance exams , i also gained alot of patience and focus for the work i do. I'm a quick and committed learner, able to grasp concepts easily, which makes me highly efficient in my work.
I'm also skilled at working in teams, both in leading and supporting peers, thanks to my experience as a school leader.

# How do you intend to contribute back to the club?
By joining the amFOSS club, I would start by assisting my peers who are facing programming challenges, using the knowledge I gain over time. 
I would be actively involved in all activities, contributing to the team and taking on leadership roles if required. 
Provide Support to all tech enthusiasts who are new to the computer world and help them develop their skills through various tasks.

# What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?
I am interested in Web Development and Machine learning. 
Web development is a constantly evolving sector in the Computer World. It allows you to visualize and implement ideas bringing them to life on the Internet.
There’s always something new to learn, whether it’s a new programming language, framework, or design trend. I'll engage myself to be familiar with the different programming languages and how to use them for development efficiently.
Since I’m an AI student, machine learning is always something that piques my curiosity. Using the data that you provide , the computers are allowed to make decisions which allows it to do numerous tasks efficiently.
I will learn more into the topic since the ideas are unlimited on how data can be used and execute them in ethical ways.
